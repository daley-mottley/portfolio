Review the contact form message input box and tell me how the placeholder animation works

Great! Now the website is multi lingual. The text is animated but instead of seeing a new line animated on the front end, I see '\n' why is that?

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of what was done to fix the newline issue:

Step 1: Identify the Problem
Issue: The typewriter animation was displaying literal \n characters instead of creating actual line breaks.

Root Cause: When text comes from multilingual/translation sources (like JSON files), the \n sequences are stored as two literal characters (backslash + n) rather than being interpreted as escape sequences.

Step 2: Locate the Code
Found the relevant functions in js/custom.js:

adjustPlaceholderText() - Formats the text for proper line wrapping
typeWriter() - Animates the text character by character
Step 3: Apply the Fix
Added a single line at the start of adjustPlaceholderText():

text = text.replace(/\\n/g, '\n');
This converts any literal \n strings into actual newline characters before the text is processed and animated.

Step 4: Verify the Fix
